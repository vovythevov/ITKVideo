/** \class VideoFileWriter
 * \brief Write an Video File and stream it using OpenCV libs
 *  Enable you to write video.
 *  
 *  (Only ?) Supports .avi format. Thus, the file you are trying to write
 *  should have this extension. 
 *  By default, the writer write a video with the codec PIM1 with 25 frame/s.
 *  Since it was made in concurrence with the VideoFileReader, it only 
 *  supports grayscale images as an input.
 *  The output is fo now encoded with pixel having a size of 1 bytes and being 
 *  unsigned.
 *  
 *  How to use : Exactly as the ImageFileWriter. Attention,t when an update is called,
 *    since itk only works with image, the VideoFileWriter only add one frame to 
 *    the video (is current input).
 *
 *  Attention, if you want to read the video, you should either :
 *    . Make sure the object VideoFileWriter is not referenced anymore 
 *      ( see \sa SmartPointer )
 *    . Call the method EndVideo() on your writer.
 *
